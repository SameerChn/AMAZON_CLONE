# Amazon Clone

A simple Amazon clone built with HTML and CSS, replicating the core layout and design of the Amazon website. This project was created as a learning exercise to improve my understanding of web development, focusing on structure, styling, and hover effects.

## Features
- Responsive Navbar with search bar, account options, orders, and cart.
- Product Grid showcasing various categories with smooth hover effects.
- Category Panel for quick navigation.
- Footer section with helpful links, similar to Amazon.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Font Awesome for icons

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-clone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd amazon-clone
   ```
3. Open `clone.html` in your browser.

## Future Improvements
- Add responsiveness for mobile devices.
- Implement JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., product search, cart functionality).
- Integrate backend for product data.
